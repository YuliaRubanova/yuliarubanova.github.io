Senior Research Scientist, Google Deepmind  â€¢  Previously: [UofT](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)

I am currently working on [Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/) generative model for video. Overall, I am interested in making image- and video- generative models that are  *controllable* and *physically-realistic*.

- controlling object location, pose and appearance in generated videos
- physically realistic interactions between objects in video
- object discovery, extracting 3D information from images and video
- using generative models as world models for robotics

Previously, I worked on *Learning Simulation* -- learning to simulate object collisions in 3D using using graph neural networks.

I completed my PhD in University of Toronto, supervised by Quaid Morris. I worked on Neural ODE for irregularly-spaced time series (advised by David Duvenaud) and on modelling cancer evolution through time. During my PhD, I did a few internships at Google Brain working on optimization of discrete objects in 2019-2020 and DeepVariant in 2018.
