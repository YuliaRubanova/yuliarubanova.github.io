I am a Research Scientist at Google Deepmind.

I am interested in structured representations of the data and including the inductive bias into the deep learning models.

I completed my PhD in University of Toronto, supervised by Quaid Morris. I worked on Neural ODE for irregularly-spaced time series (advised by David Duvenaud) and on modelling cancer evolution through time. During my PhD, I did three internships at Google Brain working on optimization of discrete objects in 2019-2020 and DeepVariant in 2018.
