I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google Deepmind, working on **video generation** with [Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/).

I am interested in *controllable* and *structured* generative models for images and video.

- physically realistic generation, temporal consistency,
- extracting 3D information from images and video
- using them for real-world applications, e.g. as world models for robotics
- my previous interests also include physical simulations from 3D states and modelling rigid objects

Previously, I worked on **Learning Simulation**, i.e. learning physics of everyday objects from real data using graph neural networks.

I completed my PhD in University of Toronto, supervised by Quaid Morris. I worked on Neural ODE for irregularly-spaced time series (advised by David Duvenaud) and on modelling cancer evolution through time. During my PhD, I did a few internships at Google Brain working on optimization of discrete objects in 2019-2020 and DeepVariant in 2018.
